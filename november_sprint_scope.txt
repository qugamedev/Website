The general idea is that the scope is effectively the same content as the
current website.

Thus, the total list of content includes:
- Links to our socials: Instagram, YouTube, Linkedin, email, Linktree.
- The invite to the discord.
- A button to subscribe via email to recieve notifications about blog posts.
- Who the executive team is, including headshots of the entire team.
- A "Home page".
- An "About" page. The content of this page is a writeup to be written by the
  Co-Chairs.
- A "Blog" page, which is a feed of posts. Clicking on any posts brings the user
  to the page for that post.
- Replace the graphic on the homepage.
